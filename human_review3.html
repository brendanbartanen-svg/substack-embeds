<h1>Reviewer 3</h1>

<p>The authors explore interest in the teaching profession based on academic achievement, race, and gender. This study contributes to the existing literature given the size of the sample and time period. The ethnoracial diversity in alternative careers is a fascinating finding, as are the geographic realities of who is interested in teaching based on the urbanity of their own schools.</p>

<p>I do have some questions about the conclusions drawn. While one interpretation is that students seek a more prestigious career, it would be important to distinguish prestige from pay. Is it that students seek careers that pay more (a rational and likely necessary decision) in light of inflation and the cost of college? Or, is it the case that they want a certain type of job title (prestige)? Who are the people who can be less wage sensitive in the US? The decline in low wage careers provides some evidence that the issue might be more fiscal than reputational, as is the shift towards nursing.</p>

<p>Also, though beyond the scope of the study, many people become teachers though they were not interested at the time of application after exposure to education classes or when they are in need of a job as they approach graduation.</p>

<h2>Sample</h2>

<p>How does the model account for changes over time in who is using the common app? Could it be the case that higher achieving students are using different platforms (i.e. Scoir)? What share of college applicants use the Common App and how has that changed over time?</p>

<h2>Similar Jobs</h2>

<p>I appreciate the difficulty of constructing similar careers. Many of the similar careers seem to require different levels/years of education and training. Are there ways to account for the years of study needed?</p>
