<h1>Reviewer 1</h1>

<p>Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper.</p>

<p>Obviously, the strength of this paper is simply the data set itself. Working with a data set of that size is a real feat, and I appreciate the care that you took to describe how developed your variables and constructed your analyses. I found the description of the methods to be lucid and logical. The assumptions were clear, limitations addressed, and decision-making processes laid out transparently. I particularly appreciated the care you have taken to contextualize your data set and its inherent limitations. Large though it might be, you note that it is not representative of all college-goers and temper your claims accordingly. As I worked carefully through your methods and findings, I don&rsquo;t have any major concerns. What I do have are a few curiosities and a couple of questions about paths not taken.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Collapsing elementary and secondary teaching interest.</strong> The first concerns your choice to collapse your two teaching interest categories into one. Namely, lumping together those interested in elementary teaching with those interested in secondary. From a parsimony perspective, I very much understand this choice. Separating these would mean essentially twice as many analyses and models. At the same time, though, I strongly suspect that these two groups of people are quite different, at least along certain dimensions. At the very least, you&rsquo;ll see a huge gender difference between the two. There are a few ways of addressing this that wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily require adding whole new swaths of analysis.
    <ol>
      <li>First would be to indicate what proportion of your respondents indicated elementary versus secondary teaching interest</li>
      <li>Next would be to explore any differences between those groups in terms of your target variables. Perhaps they aren&rsquo;t actually all that different for most of them.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><strong>No interaction terms.</strong> The other thing I noticed was that you chose not to include any interaction terms in any of your models. Of course, I would not expect a full factorial model with that many predictors. But it&rsquo;s worth speaking about the choice not to include any. For instance, I might suspect that in terms of predicting teaching interest, there might be an interesting race-gender interaction. Perhaps you did explore some of these possibilities. Either way, it&rsquo;s worth a discussion.</li>

  <li><strong>Interest over time analysis and model stability.</strong> The only analysis that puzzled me was the &ldquo;interest over time&rdquo; analysis described on page 18. To identify your pool of &ldquo;top 10% of individuals with predicted interest in teaching&rdquo; you used the model from 2015. But as you note, the population changes in some important ways over time. In terms of predicting teaching interest, how similar is the 2015 model and the 2025 model? If they&rsquo;re pretty close, then your procedure works just fine. If they&rsquo;re very different, though, you might not really be identifying the &ldquo;top 10%&rdquo; in those later years.</li>

  <li><strong>Teaching as a &ldquo;second choice&rdquo; career.</strong> One last thing to consider in your interpretations is that &ldquo;teaching interest&rdquo; only becomes evident in the case that an applicant specifies teaching as their greatest professional interest &ndash; because that&rsquo;s all the Common App gives you. Yet teaching often occupies a &ldquo;second choice&rdquo; type of career option, behind a more high-status aspirational one. There&rsquo;s no real way to probe this given your data. But it&rsquo;s worth mentioning in your discussion that there may be more interest than is immediately evident in your data.</li>
