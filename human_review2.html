<h1>Reviewer 2</h1>

<p>Overall, I think this manuscript has promise to make substantive contributions to our understanding of a key part of the educator pipeline &ndash; that of high school students&rsquo; career aspirations, particularly as it relates to the educational career options. Before it makes that contribution, there are several key issues to address including developing a more robust framework to drive the investigation, further clarity and defense around key decisions, and then connecting the results to the framework. Below are several comments aimed at refining and deepening the insights and impacts of this study. One possibility is to break this manuscript into two separate pieces to refine and deepen what is presented: Manuscript A could focus on a more nuanced understanding of those who state their interest in an educational career and Manuscript B could focus more on comparisons across similar professions (more on this later).</p>

<p>Holistically, the study is not about &ldquo;who wants to be a teacher&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;who wants to be an educator, broadly defined&rdquo; in the United States &ndash; the language and terms used should reflect this. For example, students indicating interest in administration are included in the main career variable of interest. Using the term educator better reflects what is being investigated throughout.</p>

<p>An opportunity for improving the manuscript is to present both a broad framework of the teacher pipeline and a well-developed discussion of how the portion of the pipeline focused on in this project (high school students&rsquo; interests and decisions) contributes to the overall pipeline and patterns in the labor market. While understanding the contribution of what occurs once students enroll in postsecondary institutions to the pursuit of a career in k-12 teaching is outside the scope of this paper, having some connection and/or acknowledgement of that system in the introduction and literature review would help ground the findings and recommendations. Having a figure and text which places the current study within the broader pipeline would be an improvement to ensuring this manuscript&rsquo;s contributions are linked to other parts of the pipeline.</p>

<p>What do we currently know about routes into educational careers and about preference formation/evolution in postsecondary institutions? Said another way, if once a student enters a teacher preparation program at a postsecondary institution they are equally likely as any other student to graduate, that is a very different set of implications than if amongst those enrolled in teacher preparation programs females are more likely than males to complete the program. The former suggests efforts in understanding and improving initial interest may pay dividends in growing and diversifying the teacher work force while the latter suggests the barrier exists in postsecondary programs. As of now, there is no direct implication in the introduction, the literature reviewed, or any conceptual framework that answers the &ldquo;So what?&rdquo; question about understanding high school student choices. How does gaining insights from data collected on/from high school aged students directly connect to the labor market?</p>

<p>Throughout the current manuscript, educators are grouped into one category masking the variation in who pursues teaching and administration positions at the elementary and secondary levels. The literature review could be nuanced/deepened to reflect the multiple levels and types of careers which are available within the education sector. The main variable of career interest could be nuanced to have one general education career variable (what&rsquo;s currently done), an elementary education interest variable, and a secondary education interest variable. This could then be carried forward into the methods and comparing the three patterns could become a focus of the analyses and discussion. This all contributes to the recommendation of splitting the current manuscript into two or more papers which give each type of investigation the space and focus for a more nuanced set of analyses and discussion to occur.</p>

<p>In total, the project is ambitious and novel. There are multiple contributions this project can make to the field, to our understanding and to practice. However, there is room to refine, deepen, and nuance what currently is in place. Below are more specific comments which align with the above narrative summary.</p>

<h2>Title</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The investigation is about who wants to be an educator (teacher or administrator) not a teacher.</li>
  <li>&ldquo;America&rdquo; should be &ldquo;US&rdquo; or &ldquo;USA&rdquo;; the term America is not specific to the USA (where this study takes place).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Strong set up, overall. Some room to improve clarity on page 2, lines 4&ndash;18.</li>
  <li>The first sentence on the page could be improved to more clearly state that past studies have not included things like altruism. The sentences addressing the second item in the listing could also be cleared up a bit to say most literature looks at teachers to all non-teachers rather than a closer comparison of teachers to some definition of similar careers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Literature Review</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Page 5, line 46&ndash;50 &ndash; it would be helpful to know which studies were from a single point in time, using self-reports, and of those individuals already in teaching as well as any examples which go beyond those limitations (if any).</li>
  <li>Page 5, line 53 &ndash; the &ldquo;occupational choice more broadly&rdquo; adds some lack of clarity to the sentence. I&rsquo;m not sure what it is meaning.</li>
  <li>Page 6, lines 39&ndash;33 &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure that the findings of increased teacher supply during recessions means that compensation and career stability are drivers of entry. I would see this finding to suggest that during recessions schools are not reducing the total number of teachers needed and, as such, there are teaching positions open. With other professions cutting positions or not hiring, it may mean the teacher supply strengthens.</li>
  <li>Page 6, lines 40&ndash;45 &ndash; This goes against what you mention in line 32 of the same page that compensation is an important driver of entry into teaching.</li>
  <li>Page 6, lines 47&ndash;49 &ndash; This paragraph, and the above on interests, should be revisited to smooth out and connect. As it reads, this paragraph is a transition away from composition of k-12 workforce to interest in teaching. However, the preceding three paragraphs (this subsection) are all about interest in teaching. The previous section was on composition.</li>
  <li>Throughout the literature review, there is no differentiation in teacher labor market patterns by grade level. For example, elementary teachers are even more likely to be female than high school teachers. There are also some differences by racial identity (per Bureau of Labor Statistics). These are important and meaningful nuances both in looking at if there are interesting differences out of the &ldquo;gate&rdquo; and also in interpreting findings.</li>
  <li>Tied to this, there is room to nuance the definition of the teaching profession. This is not a monolith but it is talked about as if it was. There is variation in who becomes teachers at various &ldquo;bands&rdquo; in the prek-12 system &ndash; pre-k and early childhood, elementary, middle school, and high school all are distinct. They are likely distinct in who is interested in the various grade levels, in the demographics of the labor markets, and other aspects as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Variable construction</strong> &ndash; There is a lot of valuable information which is lost when collapsing interest in elementary and secondary into a single measure of &ldquo;interest in teaching&rdquo; rather than retaining that difference. These are distinct parts of the teacher labor market (not a lot of crossover) AND likely different patterns in composition. Given that the variable is constructed with &ldquo;teacher or administrator (elementary)&rdquo; and &ldquo;teacher or administrator (secondary)&rdquo; it seems like the &ldquo;other&rdquo; responses of principal and superintendent should be included as &ldquo;interested in teaching&rdquo; rather than lumped together with things like Clergy, laborer, semi-skilled worker, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Research questions</strong> &ndash; The exact research questions are not provided in this section. They are alluded to on pages 2&ndash;3 but are not well specified. They do not need to be formed as questions but should be explicitly stated and consistently presented.</li>
  <li><strong>Application rank derived from 2023 IPEDS</strong> &ndash; Why is this year used rather than the year of application? It seems like while institutions are relatively stable, this isn&rsquo;t always the case. Either way, rationale for why this was chosen is warranted along with any possible issues/limitations with this approach.</li>
  <li><strong>Model specification and nesting</strong> &ndash; For the second type of model estimated &ndash; teaching interest and ratings from teacher recommenders, are you treating the ratings as being covered under the term X<sub>i</sub> or is it something different? It strikes me as there being a lot of concerns for multicollinearity and endogeneity in including all of these variables in a single model if not thought through. We&rsquo;ve also got students nested within teacher recommenders, within buildings, within districts, within counties, within states, within regions. I&rsquo;d think at the very least you&rsquo;d want to account for nesting within schools (and maybe districts) as nesting within recommenders seems unlikely to have a way to deal with.</li>
  <li><strong>Member characteristics model</strong> &ndash; What&rsquo;s the model used for the third set of investigations around member (institution) characteristics? Are you keeping in place the recommender ratings or dropping them back out? What&rsquo;s the rationale for each of the member characteristics included? It&rsquo;s not apparent why they are included or which direction we&rsquo;d expect the relationship to go, or if it&rsquo;d go the same way for all students or differently for different groups or interests. More justification should be included.</li>
  <li><strong>Application destination model</strong> &ndash; For the model of where those interested in teaching submit applications, it also seems like you&rsquo;re predicting the impact of applying to a college with particular characteristics on someone&rsquo;s likelihood of being interested in teaching rather than answering the question of what are the types of institutions those who are interested in pursuing teaching careers are applying to. Both are interesting but are very different questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Careers similar to teaching &ndash; fit with paper</strong> &ndash; Other than having the data, I&rsquo;m not sure how this adds to the core of the paper; it seems like a different paper all together as it isn&rsquo;t grounded in the literature reviewed or a conceptual framework. It&rsquo;s definitely interesting and worth investigation but it would need a bit more incorporation into the current study than it has at the moment.</li>
  <li><strong>Careers similar to teaching &ndash; approach</strong> &ndash; More explanation is warranted for why the approach taken to define similarity between careers &ldquo;in terms of the characteristics of the applicants&rdquo; rather than something about the careers themselves. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like you are measuring career similarity using this method; rather, what is measured is the types of careers a similar set of students select as having interest in. Said another way, starting with a definition for careers similar to teaching (based on the type of work being done, degrees/credentials needed, salaries, etc.) and then examining patterns in interest may be more insightful and lead to meaningful interventions, supports and other actions based on the results aimed at removing possible barriers to pursuing educational careers. In sum, the current approach of understanding the career choice set of similarly situated students is a reasonable investigation but is different from the rest of the paper. The suggested approach links better to understanding how the characteristics of those selecting educational careers compares with who selects similar careers. As you mention on page 21 lines 4&ndash;7, the &ldquo;compositional disparities&hellip; begin to appear well before college students make decisions about their major or career path&rdquo; so relying on these disparities to determine similar careers seems to bake in the disparities rather than show patterns in composition across similar career paths.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The order of the results is different than the methods presentation. There is room to align the order of the introduction, data, methods, and results so it flows consistently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minor Edits</h2>

<ul>
  <li>HBCUs and PBIs &ndash; define this the first time before just using acronyms.</li>
