<p><strong>Comments on AERJ-25-0644</strong></p>
<p>The authors use Common Application data from approximately 11.5 million college applicants between 2015 and 2025 to study interest in K–12 teaching as a career. The paper examines which applicant characteristics predict teaching interest, how teaching compares to demographically and academically similar careers, how interest has changed over time, and which institutions attract teaching-interested students. Key findings include that teaching-interested applicants tend to be female, white, first-generation, and have lower academic credentials; that interest in teaching declined by roughly 20% over the decade while nursing saw a 25% increase; and that racial/ethnic diversity among teaching-interested applicants lags behind similar careers. The authors supplement the main analyses with an examination of teacher recommendation letter ratings.</p>
<p>This is an interesting paper that uses a unique and large dataset to study a question that is both timely and important. The breadth of the data—covering millions of applicants across a decade—is a real strength. Several of the findings are genuinely useful for understanding the teacher pipeline, and I think the comparison of teaching to similar careers and the time trend analyses are, to me, the most valuable contributions. That said, I do have some comments that I think could strengthen the paper. Let me walk through them below.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement of career interest.</strong> I’m curious about the core variable here—career interest as reported on the Common App profile. How seriously do college applicants take this item? Is it a considered choice, or something they fill in quickly on a long application—just another field to complete? The paper notes that students select one career from a dropdown menu, but I wonder whether the authors can provide more context about where this item appears in the application process and whether there is any evidence—from prior research or from the Common App organization itself—that this is a meaningful signal of occupational intent. The distinction matters because the paper’s findings hinge on this being a reasonable proxy for “wanting to be a teacher.” If a substantial share of students who select “education” on the Common App never actually pursue teaching (or if many future teachers don’t select it), then the interpretation shifts in important ways. I appreciate that the authors acknowledge this limitation in the discussion, but I’d encourage them to engage with it more directly earlier in the paper, perhaps by discussing what is known about the relationship between stated career interest at the point of college application and actual career entry. As a related point, there is now a fairly large literature that tracks students from college application through preparation and into teaching (e.g., Bartanen &amp; Kwok, 2023), and it would be useful to know how the career interest measure maps onto these later stages of the pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Similar careers classification.</strong> I’m really intrigued by the similar-careers comparison—I think it’s genuinely one of the more interesting moves in the paper. But I do wonder whether there’s a bit of circularity here. You’re defining careers as similar to teaching based on the demographic and academic profiles of the applicants who express interest in them—via the dissimilarity index. Then you compare teaching to these careers on those same demographic and academic characteristics. To some extent, it feels like the finding that similar careers have similar applicant profiles is built into the classification approach itself. The more novel comparisons—time trends, institutional patterns, recommendation letters—are less subject to this concern, but the core RQ2 analysis comparing applicant characteristics across similar careers feels a bit tautological. I’d encourage the authors to think about what the RQ2 analysis is adding beyond the classification exercise itself. One way to address this might be to motivate the similar careers comparison differently—for example, by defining similar careers based on occupational characteristics (salary, education requirements, job tasks) rather than applicant characteristics, and then examining whether they draw similar students.</p>
<p><strong>Paper scope.</strong> To me, the paper covers a lot of ground here: applicant characteristics, career comparisons, time trends, institutional-level patterns, and recommendation letters. That breadth is genuinely a strength. But I also wonder whether it creates some real tension in the paper—I’m not always sure how all these pieces fit together. Each of these analyses could be its own paper, and at times the connections between them aren’t as clear as they could be. The recommendation letter analysis, in particular, feels to me somewhat disconnected from the rest of the manuscript. It uses a different sample (applicants with teacher recommendations who are applying to a subset of member institutions), a different unit of analysis (recommendation ratings), and speaks to a conceptually different question (how are teaching-interested students perceived by their teachers?) compared to the main analyses. I wonder whether this is essential to the paper’s narrative, or whether it might be stronger as a separate piece. More generally, I’d encourage the authors to think about what the core narrative of the paper is and to ensure that each analysis clearly contributes to that narrative.</p>
<p><strong>Sample representativeness.</strong> The Common App data are really impressive, but I think the framing of the paper’s scope needs to be tighter. The title asks “Who Wants to Be a Teacher?” but the data can only speak to who, among Common App users, expresses interest in teaching. And that’s a meaningful distinction. Missing are students applying through other platforms, students at community colleges, and people who come into teaching through non-traditional or post-baccalaureate pathways. Given that alternative certification is now a real pathway for a lot of people in many states, I wonder whether the Common App sample might systematically miss certain segments of the future teaching workforce. This isn’t fatal—the Common App is an incredibly rich data source—but the claims and framing should be appropriately bounded. Can the authors discuss more concretely how Common App users compare to the broader population of individuals who eventually enter teaching?</p>
<p><strong>Odds ratios with rare outcomes.</strong> Teaching interest is a relatively rare outcome—around 3% of applicants—and with rare outcomes, odds ratios can really overstate how big the effects actually are. The authors do reference Zhang &amp; Yu (1998) in a footnote, which is good, but the main tables report uncorrected odds ratios. I’d encourage the authors to either apply the correction throughout or consider linear probability models instead. Linear probability models would make the magnitudes more directly interpretable. As it stands, some of the reported odds ratios might give readers a pretty misleading sense of how big these effects really are in practical terms.</p>
<p><strong>Time trends and COVID.</strong> I appreciate the CEM approach—it’s a thoughtful way to adjust for compositional changes over time. But I’m curious about a couple of things. First, how sensitive are the adjusted trends to the choice of matching variables and their coarsening? It would be reassuring to see some robustness checks on that front. Second, the 2020–2021 period is obviously unusual because of COVID. Can the authors say more about whether the pandemic affected Common App usage patterns in ways that might confound the time trends? For example, did the composition of Common App users change during this period as test-optional policies proliferated and application behavior shifted? The figures suggest some interesting movement around 2020–2021, and I think readers would benefit from more discussion of this.</p>
<p><strong>Smaller comments</strong></p>
<p>The dissimilarity index used to classify similar careers is introduced somewhat abruptly. A more intuitive explanation of what it captures, perhaps with a concrete example, would help readers who are less familiar with this measure.</p>
<p>Table 2 is quite dense and difficult to parse. I wonder whether some of the columns could be moved to an appendix to make the key comparisons more visually accessible.</p>
<p>The institutional-level analysis (RQ4) is interesting but could benefit from more discussion of mechanisms. Why do certain institution types (e.g., HBCUs, MSIs) show lower teaching interest rates? The paper documents the pattern but doesn’t fully engage with what might be driving it.</p>
<p>I think the paper would benefit from some discussion of how these findings about career interest at the point of college application connect to what we know about actual teacher supply. What share of applicants who express interest in teaching actually become teachers? And conversely, what share of teachers never expressed interest in teaching on their college applications? Without this connection, it’s hard to know how to interpret the trends and patterns documented here.</p>
<p>The discussion section is generally thoughtful and avoids overreaching, which I appreciate. One place where I think it could be strengthened is in the connection between the declining interest in teaching and the simultaneous rise in nursing interest. The paper frames this as suggestive that nursing may be drawing from the same pool of potential teachers, but I’m not sure the evidence supports that interpretation directly. Is there direct evidence of substitution, or is this an inference based on aggregate trends? It’s also possible that both trends are driven by common factors—changing perceptions of job stability, salary, working conditions—rather than one causing the other.</p>
<p>Overall, I think there is a lot to like about this paper. The data are unique, the question is important, and several of the analyses are genuinely informative. My main suggestion is to think carefully about the paper’s scope and narrative coherence, and to engage more directly with the measurement limitations of the career interest variable. I believe the paper can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of the teacher pipeline with some revision along these lines.</p>
